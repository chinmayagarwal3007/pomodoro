# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built using Python's Tkinter library. It helps users manage their time effectively by following the Pomodoro technique, which encourages focused work sessions followed by short breaks.

## Features

Install Dependencies: You might need to install Tkinter if itâ€™s not included with your Python installation. Usually, it comes pre-installed with standard Python distributions.

3.Run the Application: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:
